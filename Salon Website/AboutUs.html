        <h1><b>The Founder, David Charlton</b></h1>
        <br>
        <br>
<p><b>  
David Charlton was born in Suderland, in Tyme and Wear, England, and was exposed to hairdressing at a very early age. Charlton came from a family of hairdressers-one of the most sought-after careers in England. At 16, he was working full-time at his uncle’s salon while studying at the Durham Technical College. After 3 years of studying, Charlton passed with distinction the City and Guilds of London Institute Examination in Men’s and Ladies’ Hairdressing. This distinction opened the opportunity for Charlton to go back to Tyne and Wear, tihis time in south Shields, to teach hairdressing. He also conducted workshops for the North East Hairdressers’ Federation.
<br>
    <br>
It was in 1978 when Charlton came came to the Philippines. He was the manager of Rever Salon at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and after becoming a partner and later on its sole owner, Charlton expanded the Rever Salon to five locations. In 1989, after seeing a need for a salon that would offer high quality hairdressing at a customer-friendly price, Charlton established David’s Salon Inc. With the desire to share his expertise to more Filipinos, he opened the very first David’s Salon in New Farmer’s Market in Cubao, Quezon City.
<br>
    <br>
A realization of a need that has opened many opportunities, David’s Salon not just shared a unique style to many Filipinos, but likewise opened employment and skill acquisition opportunities for many promising Filipino stylists. Now the largest chain of salons in the Philippines, David’s Salon has 200 branches, and counting. Salons are present in key locations in the Greater Manila Area as well as in the provinces. In 2008, the first US branch of David’s Salon opened in Los Angeles, California, and in February 2010, the first David’s Salon branch in the Middle East opened in Dubai.</b></p>
